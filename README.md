### Project Template 

I use different templates time to time to start with, for this one I'll start with  Netflix's Dispatch project structure.

Normally I generally use  FastAPI's official template : github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-template

Or if I foresee the project requirements (eg. if I know I use redis+celery+flask I search for a specific combo), I research on templates to start with .

### Python Environment

Throughout history I've used plain pip, poetry, pdm. For the project I'll use uv.
